# RPG-platformer
Hi! I'm glad you're here.

# What is this?
This is a rpg styled platformer, built with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).
The uniqueness of this project is the main character
having one item slot, although in the game, there are a lot of unique items, with different effects, and use cases.

Example would be a double jump wand, which will help you jump higher and further, and and a sword that can be stuck into the wall and used as a support on which to stand.

# How to play?
You have three options:
1. Clone the repository, and install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/download.html), after that, you can run the game by typing `python3 main.py` on linux or `python main.py` on windows. Also you can edit the source code and mess around with it.

    **Note:** You will have to edit the `main.py` file to run the game, because the debug version, tries to recompile the map on run, but map source code is not included in the repository. If you still want to run from the source code without editing it, read the third way to play.


2. You can download the executable from the `release/dist` folder, and run it. no need to install anything, just run the executable.


3. You can download the source code from the `release/source` folder, and run it.


# Contributing
If you want to contribute, you can fork the repository, and make your changes there.
After editing the source code, make a pull request, and the changes will be merged into the master branch after review.

**Any help is appreciated!**
